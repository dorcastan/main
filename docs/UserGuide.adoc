== Introduction

Mark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing
bookmarks*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mark
can get your bookmark organisation and note-taking done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to
<<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Here are a few steps to get you started on Mark: +

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mark.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all bookmarks
* *`add u/https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 n/Pro Git f/Tutorials`* : adds a bookmark
named `Pro Git` to Mark.
* *`delete 3`* : deletes the 3rd bookmark shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

This section describes the main features of Mark and how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
E.g. In the command format `*add* u/URL`, `URL` is a parameter which can be used as `*add* u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
E.g `u/URL [t/TAG]` can be used as
`u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg t/NUS` or as `u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Default values for optional items are specified with an `=` symbol. +
E.g. When `u/URL [t/TAG=CS2103T]` is specified in the command format, the default value for the tag is `CS2103T` if not
it is not provided.
* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. +
E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/module`,
`t/module t/read-later` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
E.g. if the command specifies `u/URL n/NAME`, `n/NAME u/URL` is also acceptable.

=== Saving the data

Mark data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command

There is no need to save data manually. It is also possible to save
Mark data with a different file name using the command `*export*`
(see <<exporting-bookmarks>>).

[[exporting-bookmarks]]
=== Exporting bookmarks: *`export`*

This command exports Mark data to a specified file on the hard disk. The saved file is
identical in format to the data file `mark.json` and can be used to save back-up copies
of Mark data.

Format: `*export* [FILENAME]`

****
* {blank}
+
`FILENAME` should not include the file extension. E.g. `myBookmarks` and not
`myBookmarks.json`
* The data file is saved at `[applicationHome]/data/bookmarks/FILENAME.json`.
If the given file already exists, it is overwritten.
****

Example:

* `*export* myBookmarks` +
Exports all bookmark manager data to a file named `mark/data/bookmarks/myBookmarks.json`
(assuming `mark.jar` is stored in the folder `mark`). The content of `myBookmarks.json`
is identical to the current content of `mark.json`.

=== Importing bookmarks: *`import`*

This command imports bookmarks from a file on the hard disk to Mark. A bookmark is, by default, imported
into a folder with the same name as its original folder (even if the folder
structure is different). If no such folder is found, the bookmark will be imported
into the folder `ImportedBookmarks`.

Bookmarks with the same name or URL as existing bookmarks are not imported.

Format: `*import* FILENAME`

****
* `FILENAME` is case sensitive and should not include the file extension. E.g.
`myBookmarks` and not `myBookmarks.json`
* `FILENAME.json` should be a file stored in the folder
`[applicationHome]/data/bookmarks/`.
* The file corresponding to `FILENAME` should have a valid format, identical
to the JSON files produced by `*export*`.
****

Example:

* `*import* myBookmarks` +
Assuming `mark.jar` is stored in the folder `mark`, imports bookmarks from the
file `mark/data/bookmarks/myBookmarks.json`.

[[Autotag-Command]]
=== Creating an automatic tag: *`autotag`*

This command creates a tag that will be automatically applied to bookmarks which match
the given conditions.

Format: `*autotag* TAG_NAME [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [u/URL_KEYWORD]... [f/FOLDER]...
[nn/NOT_NAME_KEYWORD]... [nu/NOT_URL_KEYWORD]... [nf/NOT_FOLDER]...`

****
* `TAG_NAME` should be a valid tag name. No existing autotag should have this tag name.
* At least one condition (`n/`, `nn/`, `u/`, `nu/`, `f/`, or `nf/`) must be specified.
* `NAME_KEYWORD` and `URL_KEYWORD` are used to match bookmarks in a similar way
as the keywords in `*find*` (see <<locating-bookmarks>>). The only difference is that a single
keyword parameter can contain multiple words. E.g. `n/Module W` will match names `CS2103T Module Website` and
`module work to do` but not `Future modules`.
* `FOLDER` should be the exact name of a folder (case insensitive). E.g. `wiki` will match
`Wiki` but not `Wikipedia`.
* `NOT_NAME_KEYWORD`, `NOT_URL_KEYWORD`, and `NOT_FOLDER` are name keywords,
URL keywords, or folder names that bookmarks to be tagged should *not* match.
* The tag `TAG_NAME` is still a normal tag. E.g. if an autotag `YouTube` matches
bookmarks with URLs containing `youtube.com`, other bookmarks can still be
tagged with the tag `YouTube`.

* If multiple conditions are specified, bookmarks are matched in the following way:
    ** For normal conditions (`n/`, `u/`, and `f/`), bookmarks that match at least one condition
    within the same condition type are matched (i.e. OR search). E.g. `n/wiki n/comput` will match
    names `WikiHow` and `Computer Science`.
    ** For negative conditions (`nn/`, `nu/`, and `nf/`), bookmarks that match all of the conditions
    within the same condition type are matched (i.e. AND search). E.g. `nf/Work nf/School` will
    match bookmarks that are not in the folder `Work` and not in the folder `School`.
    ** Bookmarks that match all conditions across different condition types are matched. E.g. `n/web
    n/mod f/NUS` will match bookmarks with [names that match `web` and/or `mod`] AND [are in the
    folder `NUS`].
* Note that no bookmarks will be tagged if conditions contradict each other.
E.g. `u/github.com/mark nu/github.com/`
****

Examples:

// TODO: add step-by-step screenshots of examples
* `*autotag* NUS n/NUS n/School n/Uni` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `NUS` to all bookmarks that have names containing
the keywords `NUS`, `School`, and/or `Uni`.

* `*autotag* LumiNUS u/luminus.nus.edu.sg nf/Miscellaneous` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `LumiNUS` to all bookmarks with URLs
containing `luminus.nus.edu.sg` that are not in the folder `Miscellaneous`.

* `*autotag* Quiz f/NUS f/Module nu/github nu/stackoverflow` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `Quiz` to all bookmarks that are either in
 the folder `NUS` or in the folder `Module`, and that do not contain any of the
keywords `github` or `stackoverflow` in their URLs.

=== Deleting automatic tags: *`autotag-delete`*

This command deletes a previously created <<autotag, autotag>> from Mark. Tags that are already present will
not be removed, but no bookmarks will be tagged by this autotag after it is deleted.

Format: `*autotag-delete* TAG_NAME`

****
* `TAG_NAME` should be the name of the autotag to be deleted, which is the same
as the name of the tag which it applies. E.g. an autotag that adds the tag
`ProgrammingHelp` to bookmarks is also named `ProgrammingHelp`.
****

Example:

* `*autotag-delete* Quiz` +
 Deletes the autotag that would have tagged bookmarks that match its conditions
with the tag `Quiz`. No existing tags are removed, but new and edited bookmarks
will no longer be automatically tagged with `Quiz`.

=== Saving an offline copy: *`cache`*

Saves the bookmarked website locally for offline viewing.

Format: `*cache* INDEX [s/SAVE_NOW] [u/AUTO_UPDATE] [d/VERSION]`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to save a local copy of
* `SHOULD_AUTOUPDATE` (default false) if true, it will check daily for any
updates. Any old versions will be archived and users will be able to see
the different versions and delete them / name them
* If `AUTO_UPDATE` is missing, will not auto update.
* `VERSION` is the version number to be deleted.
****

Examples:

* `*cache* 1 s/true u/true` +
Saves the bookmark at index 1 locally, and updates it daily.

* `*cache* 1` +
Show the list of cached copies.

* `*cache* 1 d/2` +
Deletes the cached version at the second index.

* `*cache* 1 u/true` +
Manually save a new copy of the site.

=== Making annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate`*

This adds a new annotation on the offline copy of the given bookmarked
website. When you give this command, the UI will switch to the offline tab showing the results of your command.
With this command, you can highlight a paragraph on the offline document and optionally attach a supplementary
note to said paragraph. (Notes can be added to justify the highlight or as
content-relevant notes for future reference to bookmark).
You can also add a general note not pertaining to any specific paragraph to the _General notes section_
located at the bottom of the document.

Overwriting an existing note is possible with this command.

NOTE: Paragraphs are identified using a numbered identifier that starts with either `P` or `S`. You can refer to the
numbered identifier in the leftmost column of the offline document to check out the respective identifier for each paragraph.

Format: `*annotate* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR=yellow]`

****
 * `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to be marked.
 `PARA_NUM` must be `NULL` or it must begin with `P` or `S` (e.g. `P3`).
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NOTES` is the content of notes to add.
 * `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. If no colour is specified,
yellow is the default colour.
If colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `*annotate* 1 p/2 n/summary of paragraph h/orange` +
This highlights paragraph 2 orange and attaches note with content “summary of paragraph” to the paragraph
in the offline copy of bookmark 1.
//TODO: add screenshots

* `*annotate* 1 p/2 h/pink` +
This overwrites any existing highlight and highlights paragraph 2 with pink
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Any notes attached remain attached.

* `*annotate* 1 p/2 n/change or add note content` +
This changes the note attached to paragraph 2 to a note with content “change or add note content”
in the offline copy of bookmark 1 if paragraph 2 had pre-existing note, and highlight
colour remains the same. Otherwise, paragraph 2 will be highlighted yellow and
a new note with content "change or add note content" will be added to the paragraph.

* `*annotate* 1 n/adding a general note` +
This adds a note with content "adding a general note" to the _General notes section_ in the
 offline copy of bookmark 1.


=== Deleting annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-delete`*

This deletes selected highlights or notes from the offline copy of the given bookmarked website.
When you give this command, the UI will switch to the offline tab showing the results of your command.
You can choose to remove just the notes and/or highlight of a paragraph, or clear all annotations
on the offline copy to revert it to a clean slate. You can also choose to remove a note from the
<<stray-notes,_General notes section_>>. If the given paragraph does not have any annotations to remove, nothing is performed.

NOTE: A general note is known to attach to a <<phantom-paragraph,_phantom paragraph_>>. As you can see in the offline
copy, phantom paragraphs do not have any content displayed; they do not belong to the original web page. Phantom paragraphs are
identified using numbered identifiers that begin with `S`, as opposed to <<true-paragraph,_true paragraphs_>>, whose identifiers begin with `P`.

You are not allowed to remove only the highlight from a phantom paragraph since it does not display a highlight in the first place.

Format: `*annotate-delete* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/KEEP_NOTES=false] [h/KEEP_HIGHLIGHT=false]`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to remove annotations of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to remove annotation(s) from. `PARA_NUM` must be either `all` or begin with `P` or `S`.
 If you entered `all` for this parameter, all annotations will be cleared regardless of other options, reverting the offline document to a clean slate.
 If you specified a phantom paragraph instead, the phantom paragraph will be deleted if `n/KEEP_NOTES` parameter is set to `false`.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or there is no annotation to delete, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_NOTES` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the notes of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the notes will be removed. `KEEP_NOTES` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_NOTES` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the highlight of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the highlight will be removed. `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT`` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/2` +
This removes both the note and highlight from paragraph 2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/2 n/true` +

* `*annotate-delete* 2 p/S1` +
This deletes the general note from phantom paragraph `S1` in the offline copy of bookmark 2.

* `*annotate-delete* 1` +
This removes all annotations of the offline copy of bookmark 1.


=== Modifying annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-edit`*

This modifies existing annotations on the offline copy of the given bookmarked
website. When you give this command, the UI will switch to the offline tab showing the results of your command.
With this command, you can choose to overwrite the existing notes to a particular paragraph with another note, change the highlight or
choose to move notes from a paragraph to another paragraph. This command also supports moving notes of a
<<phantom-paragraph, phantom paragraph>> back to the main text by specifying which true paragraph to move it to.

//TODO lift this restriction in future version
At v1.4, moving of notes to the  <<stray-notes, _General notes section_>> is not supported.

Format: `*annotate-edit* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [to/NEW_PARA_NUM] [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR]`

****
 * `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph which you want to edit annotation of.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or the corresponding paragraph does not have existing annotations, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NEW_PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to move the annotation to.
 If `NEW_PARA_NUM` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NOTES` is the content of notes to change to. Whenever notes is given, it
 replaces any pre-existing note to paragraph `PARA_NUM`, if applicable.
 * `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. When no colour is specified, the higlihgt of the source paragraph is
used.
If colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
